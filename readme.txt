User Story Map: Grocery Delivery App

=== General Thought Process ===
I began by identifying the core user experience for ordering groceries online:
1. Browsing and selecting products
2. Checking out and paying
3. Receiving and managing deliveries
These became my three epics to be the backbone of the exeperience. From there, I laid out the most important user actions, ensuring each stage of the experience had at least a few related tasks.

=== Three Key Decisions ===
1. **Limited scope to essential MVP features.**
   I focused on features necessary for a functional grocery delivery experience (browse, cart, checkout, tracking) instead of including every nice-to-have option.
   

2. **Used time estimates and status to simulate agile progress.**
   I assigned “Done,” “In Progress,” etc. statuses to demonstrate prioritization for this project
   

=== Extra Feature Tried ===
I added **colour** to the board to go beyond what was discussed in the lab. This provided a clearer organziation for the tasks to be divided more visually. As well as adding annotations so it gives mroe context in the "hypothetical"
