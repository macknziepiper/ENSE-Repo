User Story Map: Grocery Delivery App

=== General Thought Process ===
I began by identifying the core user journey for ordering groceries online:
1. Browsing and selecting products,
2. Checking out and paying,
3. Receiving and managing deliveries.
These became my three epics to be the backbone of the exeperience. From there, I laid out the most important user actions, ensuring each stage of the experience had at least a few related tasks.

=== Three Key Decisions ===
1. **Limited scope to essential MVP features.**
   I focused on features necessary for a functional grocery delivery experience (browse, cart, checkout, tracking) instead of including every nice-to-have option.
   → This is reflected by the “Release 1” tasks focusing on core flow only.

2. **Used time estimates and status to simulate agile progress.**
   I assigned “Done,” “In Progress,” and “To Do” statuses to demonstrate iteration and prioritization.
   → These are shown directly on each card in the board.

3. **Added Personas for better user empathy.**
   Including personas like “Busy Parent” and “College Student” helped visualize which user stories matter most.
   → Captured through the extra feature in StoriesOnBoard.

=== Extra Feature Tried ===
I added **Personas** to the board to go beyond what was discussed in the lab. This provided a clearer user-centered design approach.
